Installed mocha/chai as dependencies need to npm install
Very briefly set up the file structure, followed the example of other Katas


Questions
TA:

What is mocha and chai? 

Test items are in html elements, how?

DMG mentioned to build a function that automatically displays everything
    Can put all functions in an array or object, and have function loop over, taking
    the title and function, running each function

Instructions point to html file to place js code in, 
    should we redesign assignment to work with.

Users are going to go both ways, script in js or html, 
    should assignment force one way or the other?  
    
This is possibly taking out minor learning experiences
    if we force students to act in certain ways without experiencing themselves
    unless we tell them something is best practice
