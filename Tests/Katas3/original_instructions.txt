Overview
You will create a single web page, with a labelled heading for each individual kata followed by your solution. For these katas, instead of using console.log() or document.write(), you are required to insert your results into the HTML using the document.createElement() and node.appendChild() methods.

The easiest way to get started is by copying the example file from Mini-Lesson: Inserting new Elements within a Page. You can copy and paste from the code embedded in the lesson.

You can keep adding each new kata onto the bottom of that page.

Several of the katas will use the following sample array, which you can copy and paste into your code:

const sampleArray = [469, 755, 244, 245, 758, 450, 302, 20, 712, 71, 456, 21, 398, 339, 882, 848, 179, 535, 940, 472]; 
Note that the first 10 katas should seem familiar: they are a repeat of the ones you did in Assessment: Javascript Katas 1. This time you will be inserting the results into your HTML page rather than simply logging them to the console.

Display 20 solid gray rectangles, each 20px high, with widths ranging evenly from 105px to 200px (remember #4, above).
Display 20 solid gray rectangles, each 20px high, with widths in pixels given by the 20 elements of sampleArray.
As in #21, but alternate colors so that every other rectangle is red.
As in #21, but color the rectangles with even widths red. 
Bonus
If you would like an additional challenge, try completing each of the above again without using any for or while loops.
